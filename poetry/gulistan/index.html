    The <em>Gulistan</em>
    (The Rose Garden) of Sa‘di of Shiraz (d. 1292) is a source of proverbs in Persian, much like Shakespeare’s work is in the English language, and it has inspired such American poets and philosophers as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. The <em>Gulistan</em>
    contains anecdotes that offer practical, moral, and philosophical wisdom. This page comprises two illustrations from the opening chapter entitled “The Conduct of Kings.” The lower register depicts a king who had given a large sum of money to a beggar who squandered it and then returned for more. At first, the king refused the beggar additional money, but his minister advised him to allot the poor man an allowance in installments so that he would not squander it. This anecdote is meant to illustrate that one should not render someone hopeful by an act of unbounded kindness and then dash his or her hopes.
