Islamic World Kiosk
===================

Description: The Islamic World Kiosk for the Walters Art Museum displays islamic artworks and manuscripts from the museum's collection. It is built upon earlier versions that accompanied a focus show titled "Poetry and Prayer".

## Project Setup

This site was built using Jekyll, so that it can run off-line on the kiosk machine in the galleries. See also: 
    Jekyll documentation: http://jekyllrb.com/
    This projects `_config.yml` file

Assets for this site are currently stored in a web directory at http://poetryprayer.thewalters.org/v2/_assets That directory will be moved to the kiosk machine, when the site is completed.

I'll add more notes to the project wiki as needed.
