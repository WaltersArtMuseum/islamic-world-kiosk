<p>Qasidat al-burda (Poem of the mantle) is a popular hymn praising the prophet Muhammad. It was written by Sharaf al-Din al-Busiri (born ca. 1212), an Egyptian poet, calligrapher, and celebrated reciter of the Qur’an. The verses are considered to have miraculous powers and are often recited at funerals. According to tradition, al-Busiri, lying paralyzed from a stroke in his bed, dreamed that the prophet Muhammad threw a cloak over him. Miraculously, he was healed. These illuminated pages begin with the basmala, the formula that begins every chapter of the Qur’an (with a single exception), and is commonly said before initiating any worthy act. It is translated as “In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.”</p>
