        <p>The striking beauty of this page is defined by the use of alternating black naskh and gold thuluth. The naskh panels are flanked by illuminated medallions with a gold tooled outline. The gold thuluth lines are set apart by outlines resembling clouds. Gold rosettes mark the verse endings. The stamp in the left margin is the personal seal of Wazir Ali Pasha who gave the book to an educational charity in A.H. 1130/A.D. 1717.</p>

        <p>This manuscript opens with an illuminated ‘unvan (headpiece) containing the invocation, “in the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate,” written in tawqi‘ script. Fluid and curvilinear, tawqi‘ script is used for headings and rarely used for the main text. As seen here, while having inscribed the headpiece with tawqi‘, the scribe wrote the main text in alternating black naskh and gold thuluth. The naskh panels are framed by medallions with a gold tooled outline. The contours of the thuluth lines are decorated with blue tendrils over a ground of red hatched lines. Gold rosettes mark the verse endings. The stamp in the right margin is the personal seal of Wazir Ali Pasha who gave the book to an educational charity in A.H. 1130/A.D. 1717.</p>
