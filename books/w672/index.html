        <h3>W.672: Album of Ottoman Calligraphy</h3>
        <p>
            An album (muraqqa‘) of calligraphy in the form of an accordion book put together by an anonymous collector, probably in the 12th century AH/ 18th CE. It consists of leaves bearing fragmentary passages from the Qur’an (Sūrat al-baqara, 2:65-68 and Sūrat al-nisā, 4:103-106), some sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, and two sheets of pen exercises (ḳaralama). Folio 5a bears the name of the celebrated Ottoman calligrapher Şeyh Hamdullah (Ḥamd Allāh al-Amāsī, d. 926 AH /1520 CE).

       Turkey, 16th century; decorative borders 18th century
     </h3>
           <p>
               These two pages are attributed to Seyh Hamdullah (died ca. 1520), the most celebrated calligrapher in 16th-century Ottoman Turkey. He was particularly known for his mastery of the “Six Pens,” which refer to a series of rounded scripts developed during the 13th century in Iraq. The Six Pens were often employed for religious texts. These folios are inscribed with passages from Hadith literature (accounts of what the Prophet Muhammad did or said) and are written in naskh and thuluth, two of the Six Pens. Naskh, the smaller hand, is used for the text on the lower portion and thuluth for the top lines. The marbled decorative borders date to the 18th century.

<h4>Folio 5a</h4>
<img src="w672_5a.jpg" alt="Folio from an Islamic Manuscript" style="width:100%;" />
<p>
  This page bears a colophon which may be translated as follows:
“This was written by Ḥamdu Llāh, [who is] known as the sheikh's son, [while] praising God -exalted is he- and praying for his messenger Muhammad and his family, the pure ones, all of them, and praying for their safety. [This was] at the time of his hoariness as his hair glistened white and his head trembled and he was close to the to a state of decrepitude, being 80 and some odd years old. May God have mercy on those who act equitably and forgive and those who consider [things] closely and pray, because mankind was made to abide in deficiency and here am I, characterized by forgetfulness and disobedience.”
</p>
<h4>Folio 6b</h4>

<p>
  This page is a sheet of practice exercises (ḳaralama) by the calligrapher.
